## Description

With SKKeyboardResigner you can forget about resigning the keyboard by yourself by adding a big button inside a view or doing some 'Ã±apas' like that. This library takes care of resigning the keyboard for the view you want without doing nothing.

## Usage

There are two ways of using this library

1.
Set your UITextFields inside a view container and set the View to subclass SKKeyboardResignerView

2.
You can directly call the SKKeyboardResigner class methods:

![alt text](https://github.com/skyweb07/SKKeyboardResigner/blob/master/Resources/subclass_sample.png?raw=true"Subclass sample")

```objective-c
[SKKeyboardResigner attachObserverToView:viewToObserve]; // If you only want to observe that View UITextFields subviews
```

or

```objective-c
[SKKeyboardResigner attachObserverToView:viewToObserve textFieldsToObserve:textField1, textField2, nil]; // If you want to observe any view and any UITextFields
```

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

SKKeyboardResigner is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
